A quick and dirty hack to get replica sets and sharding going painlessly.

To set things up, just run ./start.sh after setting a data source in fetch_mongo.sh.

Once the script is complete, you should have the following running:

Mongos 1 (Port 27017)
Mongod 1 (Port 30000) <- Primary
Mongod 2 (Port 30001) <- Secondary
Arbiter 1 (Port 40000)
Config 1 (Port 50000)
Config 2 (Port 50001)
Config 3 (Port 50002)

Data and logs are stored in /tmp/mongo_sandbox.
Running ./reset.sh shuts everything down and removes /tmp/mongo_sandbox.

Don't run this alongside a standard mongo install as it does a killall mongod
to shut things down.
